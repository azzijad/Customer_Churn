## Customer_Churn

In this Project, I explore a dataset from Maven Analytics.

The telecom company needs help figuring out the churn risks as well as high value customers to better tailor their services to retain these customers and reduce churn and associated costs.

I used SQL to Load, Clean and Explore the dataset. Tableau was also useful in having some visual aid to better understand the data, dashboard can be found <a href='https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jad.azzi/viz/CustomerChurnAnalysis_16604456033140/Dashboard1'>HERE</a>. Finally, I used Python ML to create a predictive churn model. This was a great opportunity to brush up on some statistics such as Linear Regression, Odds and probability and dive deeper into Logistic Regression.

Feel free to comment and share any thoughts you might have.
